## 1. Project Overview 😄
This project is a simple to-do app designed to enhance my understanding of the JavaScript DOM and the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations at a basic level.  

#### Features  
- **Add Tasks**: Users can enter tasks one at a time, and upon pressing Enter or submitting the form, the task is added to the main list.  
- **Mark as Complete**: When a task is completed, users can click the "tick" icon to move it to the "Done" list.  
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks from the main list.  
- **Clear Completed Tasks**: A single button allows users to clear all tasks from the "Done" list.
